<h3 id="RaspiControl">RaspiControl:</h3>
<p>A web application using the Flask framework. Allows the user to register on the app, stores their information within a database while hashing their information for security. The app will allow the user to then login to their account and have full control over their raspberry pi from the web.</p>

The appliaction is still under development but there are many things to come.

**Planned Improvements:**
- Account settings
- Chat features
- Live video feed
- Customizable graphical data
- Bluetooth connectivity to external devices
- Habit learning
- And much more

<h3 id="DogFeeder">Automatic Dog Feeder:</h3>
<p>A text based application that allows the user release dog food into a bowl remotely. Motion sensing will record the time when the dog comes to check for food and uses the data to construct a plot that can be view over the web. Machine learning algorithims will then be used to suggest the optimal times to feed your dogs.</p>

The appliaction is still under development but there are many things to come.

**Planned Improvements:**
- GUI
- Machine Learning Model
- Text Notifications
